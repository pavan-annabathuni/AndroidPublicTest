Soil tests indicate whether crop nutrients are deficient and, if so, what amounts are needed for optimum growth. It helps to identify problems related to imbalances in nutrients, pH, salts, and organic matter. On the basis of the test report, recommendations will be provided that help increase productivity and profits.</string>

The frequency of soil testing also depends on the crops grown. For annuals such as Corn, Mustard, Lettuce, Wheat, Maize, and Rice the soil should be tested once every year. For perennial plants such as Grapes, Lemons, Bananas, Figs, Asparagus, and Papayas the soil should be tested prior to planting and once every two to three years. However frequent soil testing helps to decide whether the current management is affecting future productivity and farm profitability.</string>
